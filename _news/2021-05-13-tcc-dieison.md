Today my student [Dieison Morozoli da Silva](https://twitter.com/geodieison?s=08) defended his BSc thesis. Using long-term Landsat time series he found that sand areas in the [Puitã river watershed](https://goo.gl/maps/JTfK7Ka8RHD8SNru7), Southern Brazil, have increased by 17 km² since 2000. Here is a 3D view of the study area:
