## Linking Earth observation to global supply chains to support sustainable development

Complex international supply chains drive land-use changes worldwide, creating local environmental and social impacts that are spatially heterogeneous. Linking these impacts to the production of specific commodities is thus key to analyzing the sustainability of consumption patterns. However, spatial information on the sourcing sites for raw materials (e.g. crops and minerals) are usually not reported. In my talk to the [Institute for Geoinformatics (Ifgi)](https://www.uni-muenster.de/Geoinformatics/en/) at the MÃ¼nster University I presented recent advances using Earth observation data to map commodities production and environmental impacts driven by global demand.
