[dtwSat 0.2.7](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dtwSat/) is available on CRAN. Here are the main changes:

- Flexible time-weight function: [dtwSat 0.2.7](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dtwSat/) supports user defined time-weight function for TWDTW analysis

- The new version drops support to parallel processing: support to parallel process integrated in the package was not efficient and relaying on old packages. A future release will add more efficient parallel processing support. 

- [dtwSat 0.2.7](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dtwSat/) adds a minimalist function called `twdtwReduceTime` that is 3x faster than `twdtwApply`. This removes all unnecessary processing and only keeps the final classification results.
