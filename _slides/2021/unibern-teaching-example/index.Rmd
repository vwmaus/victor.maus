This lecture is an excerpt of the lecture: **Introduction to data cubes and change detection**

## Today's learning objectives

- Recall the concepts of satellite image time series and data cubes

- Create satellite image data cubes using R

- Extract and visualize single time series and maps

???

- The main objective of the course on Applied Spatial Data Science I is to prepare you to solve interdisciplinary problems using geodata and programming

- In the first unit, concluded last week, we learned the basic concepts of spatial data science and how to use R programming language for geodata handling and analysis

- Today I will introduce you to data cubes and change detection

- This topic is extremely relevant, for example, to measure Sustainable Development Goals Indicators related to forest cover and land-use changes. As we will see in today's application on Iligal gold mining within the Indigenous Territory Kayap贸.

- Let's start by introducing the concept of satellite image time series

---
# Sequence of images acquired at different dates

- SITS as the name says, is a sequence of images from the same location acquired at different times

- In this slide we see a sequence of satellite images from the city of Vienna

- Kindle prepared by my master student Lorenz Wimmer who investigated environmental inequalities in Vienna using satellite images time series 

- To make a time series, these images must be properly georeferenced so that pixel in one image correspond the same location in the other images

- If the images are correctly georeferneced we can stack them --- making a pile of images --- a time series

---

- Obviously, a pile of images can produce very nice videos and animations of changes on the Earth's surface

- But it can also produce extremely relevant information for a range of applications, e.g. Urbanization, Forest and habitat loss, crop helpth monitoring relevant for food security, and many more.... 

- Look at this illustration

# Land-use trajectory

???

- Note that we move from comparing image snapshots to analysis complete time series 

- When we look into a single location we can see the history of what has happened in that location 

- On the left hand side we have a sequence of satellite images -- in this case the vegetation index EVI, which you probably remember from your Geoprocessing course -- In short higher EVI values mean more green vegetation 

- And on the right hand side we visualize the values of the vegetation index of a single pixel over time

- I have added some labels here based on ground information --- this is a real data point in the Brazilian Amazon 

- Initially the area is cover with forest, but in the beginning of 2002 a deforestation event happened 

- After that, the area has been used for cattle razing until 2005

- And converted to agriculture in 2006

- We can call that the land-use trajectory of the area, which is a extremely important information for sustainable land management and planing 

- For example, this information can be used to understand drivers of change, what caused the deforestation? Cattle razing or agriculture? 

- Soils in the amazon region are not apt for agriculture immediately after the forest cut, they require a few years of rest to correct Ph for example before crop plantations can be introduced

- Now that we know what SITS are and that time series can provide valiuable information on land-use changes

- Let's see how they loook like in our comuter systems

# Data Cube

- Imagine what a data cube is. How does that look like to you?

- If you have imagined something else then this, please let me know, because you have had an innovative idea on how to structure spatiotemporal data ;) 

- But keep this innovative idea aside for now, and let's at our classical data cube representation 

- A satellite data cube has at lease three dimensions, latitude, longitude, and time

- But it can also have more dimensions

- higher-dimensional cubes -- The hypercubes

# Higher-dimensional cubes (hypercubes)

.footnote-left[Figure source: [Pebesma (2021)](https://r-spatial.github.io/stars/)]

???

- As we can see in this illustration hypercubes can have several reflectance bands

- A single hipercube can also include images from several satellite sensors (multi-sensor data cube)

- In this illustration the dimensions are split for visualization propose, but in our computer system, they are all part of the same data hipercube

- Until now we learned what satellite time series are and how they are represented in the computer systems as data cubes

# Mining within the Indigenous Territory Kayap贸 in Brazil

![:scale 70%](./img/kayapo.gif)

???

- In this animation we observe the land-cover changes in the Indigenous Territory Kayap贸 in Brazil from 2018 to 2020, where small scale gold mining takes place

- Small scale gold mining within Indigenous Territories in Brazil is a very old topic

- But over the last two to three years conflicts between indigenous populations and miners have increased, gaining international attention because of its effects on the well-being of indigenous populations and on the tropical forest and biodiversity conservation

- In the next slides we will build a data cube for this area and give a close look at a time series example

pto <- st_sfc(pto, crs = st_crs(kaiapo_cube))

# Create a buffer a buffer around the point to subset the cube
pto_buffer <- st_buffer(pto, 2000)

# Subset the data cube to a buffer around the point

# transform time series into a table 
ts <- tibble::as_tibble(ts)

# Plot time series as a line 
plot(ts$time, ts$attr, type = "l")

# Add time series observation points to the lines 
points(ts$time, ts$attr)

.left-column[**Assignment:** Investigate temporal patterns from different pairs of coordinates within our area. For example, the pair of coordinates `476361.7, 9239393.0` is within an agricultural crop area. How does it differ from the time series in the mining area? Can you identify other interesting temporal patterns?]
