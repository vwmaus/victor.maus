I am a researcher in Geoinformatics and GIScience interested in environmental modeling and monitoring to understand drivers of global environmental change. My research has contributed to new methods for analyzing large satellite image data sets and help better understand the interactions between environment and human activities. As an advocate of free software and open and reproducible science, I also contribute to science and society by publishing data and software under open licenses.

I am experienced in IT, software development, management of servers and web services. To support my research, I have developed software and tools to visualize, handle and analyze large volumes of heterogeneous geodata, from statistical surveys to citizen science and satellite earth observations. These include R packages for satellite time series analysis [dtwSat](https://www.cran.r-project.org/package=dtwSat) as well as geodata [visualization tools](https://www.fineprint.global/visualisations).

I have built a strong international network, collaborating with scholars from different fields and universities. Many of these collaborations have resulted in scientific publications and project applications. With this experience and support, I am now pursuing my own independent research funding, including projects already under review that will help my to establish my own research group.
