Welcome to my webpage. I am a researcher at the Institute for Ecological Economics at Vienna University of Economics and Business, as well as at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA). My research is centered on spatial data science, particularly focusing on the development of machine learning techniques to analyze geospatial data, with applications in land use change and sustainability. Among my main scientific contributions are the development of the Time-Weighted Dynamic Time Warping (TWDTW) algorithm and the production of the first global land-use map on mineral extraction.
