- More than 30K downloads from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dtwSat) with known scientific and business applications
`install.package("dtwSat")`
- Development version [github.com/vwmaus/dtwSat](https://github.com/vwmaus/dtwSat)]

???

- One of my main scientific contribution is

- Previous speakers, ...

- While investigating... 1000 times less 

- TWDTW steps -- library -- matches 

- Matches to maps time series 

- Assemble crop maps 

- Open source software 

- CRAN + GitHub

1. Further development - RP IIASA

2. Explain TWDTW in this context 

3. Link to ERC 

4. Dynamic programming approaches

5. Long-term climate + Vegetation + Snow

- Investigate whether different crop management practices can be detected from satellite image time series

**Why most land cover maps dismiss mining in the classification system?**
]
]

???

- Contribute to open data 

- Lead geodata workpackage

- Map + Link + Calculate

- Missing data hit again 

- Dismiss mining from classification systems 

- Illustration ESA CCI Land cover 

- We see several red urban areas  

- However, the biggest Iron mine 

- Why they are dismissed from 

- Algorithm x labeled data 

- Labeled data is missing 

- They look different

???

- Therefore, I argue for a new methodological paradigm in land-use change analysis 

- Extract events from time series

- "How can we do that?" 

- Event-based land information would Open up 

- land-use trajectories 

- Causal analysis using logic of events 

- With this I close ....

- After looking

- and reflecting on future required skills for Geographers...

- I identified ASDS, as a key field

- SDS is emerging as a field -- IFGI is incorporating 

- Why Applied?

# Applied Spatial Data Science

.left-column.font-dark[
  &lt;img src="./../img/what-is-sds.png" /&gt;
  
Applied SDS because it will focus on concepts and usage of common spatial data science infrastructures and software for interdisciplinary problems.

.right-column.mt0[

### Applied Spatial Data Science I (BSc Level)

- Reproducibility and open science
- Geocomputation with R (e.g. GIS operations using vector data, remote sensing data, and data cubes)
- Pattern detection and clustering (e.g. using machine learning algorithms)
- Geodata visualization and sharing

### Applied Spatial Data Science II (MSc Level)
- Big-Data and cloud computing
- Pattern detection (Deep learning)
- Predictive analysis

- Concepts and usage

- Not on theoretical elaboration of the mathematics, statistics and informatics

- Application oriented teaching, interdisciplinary problem

- I foresee two

- BSc level

- MSc level

- These components will strongly position the institute

# Conclusions 

--

### Short-term research plan
  - Developing methods and producing new data on the global mining sector, including 2D and 3D mapping
  - Investigating a range of applications related to mining and land-use change
  - Investigate whether different crop management practices can be detected from satellite image time series

--

### Long-term research plan
  - Develop methods to extract event-based information from satellite earth observation time series
  - Investigate causal links in land-use change

--

### Potential initial collaborations topics with GIUB (but not limited to)
- Remote sensing: Vegetation and snow time series analysis
- Climatology: Detecting patterns in long-term climate time series
- Land systems and sustainable land management: mapping and monitoring land management systems using earth observation data
- Economic Geography: regional development and mining

???

- Besides 

- International collaborations

- Experience in land-use change in Brazil
