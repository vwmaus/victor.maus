# Driver of environmental changes

## Motivate: why is it important to understand drivers of global environmentla changes? To plan interventions to ensure sustainability (and fairness????)

## What is needed for that --

# Soy supply chains in Brazil

- Applied research I contribute to...

- Explain in short the work with Boku. How does Satellite + surveis + other data source feed into reconstruct supply chains and why is it important. Close on how event-based information could improve this analysis (causal inference and indirect land-use).

- Machine learning algorithms mapping... optimization for supply chains.... ????

- Application 2: Mineal extraction and regional developemtn

- Automated Depp-learning mapping 

- Volumetric changes using SAR data in collaboration with DLR

- Event-based reprensetation of mining: 4D entity (t, x, y, z) in contrast to 3D (t, x, y) land-use changes.

# Copernicus land cover data set 

- I have contributed to global spatial accuracy analysis --- Copernicus global land cover data -- Refer to report. 

- It is available from Google Earth Engine plantfor or XXXXX
