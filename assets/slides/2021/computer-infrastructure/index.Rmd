  - **Access to HPC CPU and GPU clusters:**. The cluster will be used for large scale applications. UBELIX would proved sufficient resources, besides having a pretty cool name. 

  - **A data server minimum 24 cores, 64GB RAM, 10TB storage capacity:** The server will host Geoserver and Rstudio server. It will be used for development and test of algorithms, small scale analysis, geodata storage persistent storage and share. 

  - **Infrastructure for teaching:** Computer lab and access to cluster for students.

.center.bg-washed-blue.b--dark-blue.ba.bw2.br3.shadow-5.mb1[**Software**]

  - Linux operating system and set of open source software, R, Python, GDAL, PostgreSQL+PostGIS, etc.

  - Overleaf license for online collaborative Latex witting.

  - According to <https://www.overleaf.com/edu/unibe> University of Bern already provides the license for staff and students. Is it correct?

  - What hardware is available in the IT infrastructure of the climatology unit? 
  
  - UBELIX team charges for additional storage. Are there any additional costs for processing in UBELIX using CPU/GPU?
  
  - Are there satellite data archives available to be processed on the UBELIX cluster? If not, would it be possible?
