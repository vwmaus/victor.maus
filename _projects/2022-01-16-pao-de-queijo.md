### Ingredients

- 500 g cassava sour starch (*Polvilho azedo*)
- 100 ml water
- 100 ml milk
- 100 ml oil
- 200 ml warm water
- 2 eggs
- 200 g of grated cheese
- 1 teaspoon of salt

### Preparation

- Altogether, boil 100 ml water, 100 ml milk, and 100 ml of oil.
- Meanwhile, mix the sour starch, salt and 200 ml warm water. Mix well using the hands.
- Add the boiling solution to the dough and mix well using a spoon.
- Beat the two eggs and add to the dough.
- Add the cheese and mix well.
- Make small balls (or little piles) and bake them in the oven at 200 째C for 15 - 20 min or until they are golden coloured. This will depend on the size of the balls. 


*Notes:*
- I usually store the dough in the fridge to use the next day. I add a bit of oil to the surface of the dough and cover it to conserve moisture.
- I have also used sweet cassava starches (*Polvilho doce*). It works well, but my family prefers P찾o de queijo made of cassava sour starch (*Polvilho azedo*).
