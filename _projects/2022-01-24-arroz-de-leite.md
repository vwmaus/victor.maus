### Ingredients

- 1/2 cup of rice
- a cinnamon stick (whole)
- 1 L of milk
- 1/4 cup of sugar
- a bit of salt

### Preparation

- Wash the rice.
- In a pan, cover the rice with a little water and cook for a few minutes together with the cinnamon.
- Add the milk and cook on low heat until creamy.
- Add the sugar and salt and cook quickly just until the sugar dissolves.

*Notes:*
- Cinnamon ground goes well on the top.
- It is nice to eat while warm, but it tastes nice cold from the fridge.
